                The famously arty neighborhood of the ’70s and ’80s has evolved into one of New York City’s prime shopping districts. SoHo (an acronym for South of Houston Street) still features galleries, though these days the work within them tends toward the more high-end commercial—matching the luxury boutiques and independent-designer outposts that characterize the area. Once you’ve had your dose of retail therapy, take a break with a meal at one of the neighborhood’s many excellent restaurants or a drink at one of its elegant boutique hotels.
