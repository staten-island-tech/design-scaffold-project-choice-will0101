        bio: "With the 1973 model the Corvette enters its third decade of production and now, as in the beginning in 1953, it is America's only sports car. Considering his present stature, it is surprising to find that Duntov was not a part of the original Corvette project. However, he was soon drawn into it and he is certainly the architect of its performance image that began to emerge with the 1956 models. Since then his influence has grown to the point where he is known worldwide as the Father of the Corvette, a position all the more remarkable in Detroit, the land of the committee car. So it follows, then, that if you are to understand the Corvette you must not only drive it with an open mind but also hear of it from Duntov.",
